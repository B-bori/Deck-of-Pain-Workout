# Deck-of-Pain-Workout
You assign a workout to a suit (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades) 
Example:  
Diamonds: Push-ups   
Clubs: Squats   
Hearts: Burpees   
Spades: Crunches    

Then simply start drawing cards the number on the card indicates the number of reps of the exercise you do.  
I usually do Aces and Face Cards (King, Queen, Jack) as 10 reps.   
So if you draw the 5 of Diamonds you would do 5 push-ups, draw the Ace of Spades and you do 10 crunches.
